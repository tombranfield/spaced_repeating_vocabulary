## Learning Foreign Language Vocabulary with Spaced Repetition

A PyQt-based program for learning foreign language vocabulary with spaced repetition.

Based loosely off Memrise - I wanted to make my own version of the program since I was getting frustrated with it. 

You can load word lists. There are learn and review type quizes for drilling words using multiple choice and typing quizes. You can have strict-typing if you want.

Requires Python >=3.7
