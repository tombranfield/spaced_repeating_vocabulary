## Learning Foreign Language Vocabulary with Spaced Repetition

A Python/PyQt/SQLite-based program for learning foreign language vocabulary using spaced repetition

Based loosely off Memrise - I wanted to make my own version of it since I was getting frustrated with their business.

Create word lists and learn them using a combination of multiple choice and typing tests at particular set
intervals to aid recall and retention

Requires Python >=3.7

My [Memrise Scraper](https://github.com/tombranfield/memrise_scraper) might be useful to get words to learn.
